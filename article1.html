        <p>During the summer, we generally see fewer people using our buses as people are off work and school and so we reduce the number of buses on the road for the high frequency routes. This allows us to save money during this period of lower demand - however, we make sure there are still plenty of buses to get you to where you need to go.</p>
          <p>This also allows us to ensure that more of our employees can have their holidays too!

We also sometimes make other changes to make our routes better.</p>
          <p>What's changing?
This year, the only routes changing from Monday 29 July are lion 4/X4, emerald 5 and 6 and purple 17. For the most part, customers should not really notice any difference as most of the changes we have made are very minor.
          </p>
          <p>lion 4/X4
The changes to the lion see the buses no longer visiting the Vodafone Waterside site - this is due to the closure of the Vodafone offices there. This will slightly change the arrival and departure times of those journeys at Bracknell bus Station.</p>
          <p>The final lion X4 journey from Bracknell to Reading, Monday to Saturday (currently leaves Bracknell 11.50pm) will no longer run due to low usage. </p>
          <p>
          emerald 5 and 6
Emerald 5 will just see a slightly reduced number of buses on the road - with the main frequency still being up to every 8 minutes - so the current printed timetable still applies. Most customers, will not notice any changes to their buses. Emerald 5 will return back to its current timetable in September.

Emerald 6 also sees a slightly reduced number of buses in the timetable, but there will also be some very minor tweaks Monday to Friday as well. Buses will be up to every 10 minutes. New timetables will be on bus soon.</p>
          <p>purple 17
Purple 17 sees a slightly reduced number of buses in the timetable and there will also be some very minor tweaks Monday to Friday outside of the main 7 minute frequency. New timetables will be on bus soon.</p>
